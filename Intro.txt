The Republican debates are starting up, however there are too many canidates. Therefore in good Republican fashion you have 
	decided to make a ritual stew to imbue your chosen canadate with the power of the Elephant and send them into the 
	presidency. As a lucky happanstance, the ritual will get rid of all your extra canidates!
It's blatently corrupt. But that's the point.
