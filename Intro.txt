Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the 2016 Republican Nominations, hosted by yours truly...
the floating head of Ronald Reagan.
The good news is that our soon-to-be nominee will definitely be the most entertaining yet.
The bad news is that the losers will be ritually sacrificed and made into a stew.


---

﻿The year is divisible by four -- and now, more than ever, is it essential that our party chooses
the best candidate for upcoming presidential election. 
In the natural seclusion of the California woods, four lucky candidates will compete in a final 
debate to decide, once and for all, who will be the next nominee of the GOP.

The debate will consist of three rounds. Each candidate must answer the question provided by the
giant, looming statue of Ronald Reagan, blessed be his name. 
Throughout the debate, the audience will be voting for their favorite candidate, so our debaters 
will need to cater their answers to the needs and wants of their audience. 

After each round, the candidate with the lowest points will be ritually sacrificed and melted in
a boiling concoction. 
At the end of the debate, the winning candidate will drink the essence of his three slain opponents, 
so that he may be imbued with the Power of the Elephant. 

Sure, it’s blatantly corrupt. But it works.

The Republican debates are starting up; however, there are too many canidates. 

Therefore, in good Republican fashion, we have decided to make a ritual stew.

This will imbue your chosen canadate with the power of the Elephant and send them into the 
presidency. As a lucky happanstance, the ritual will get rid of all your extra canidates!
