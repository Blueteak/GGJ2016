The year is divisible by four -- and now, more than ever, is it essential that our party chooses
the best candidate for upcoming presidential election. In the natural seclusion of the California 
woods, four lucky candidates will compete in a final debate to decide, once and for all, who will
be the next nominee of the GOP.

The debate will consist of three rounds. Each candidate must answer the question provided by the
giant, looming statue of Ronald Reagan, blessed be his name. Throughout the debate, the audience 
will be voting for their favorite candidate, so our debaters will need to cater their answers to 
the needs and wants of their audience. 

After each round, the candidate with the lowest points will be ritually sacrificed and melted in
a boiling concoction. At the end of the debate, the winning candidate will drink the essence of 
his three slain opponents, so that he may be imbued with the Power of the Elephant. 

Sure, it’s blatantly corrupt. But it works.
